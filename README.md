# Credit Risk Analysis

## An Overview of the Analysis:

The objective of this analysis is to use Supervised Machine Learning to create a model to evaluate loan risk. We will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to create a model that can pinpoint the creditworthiness of borrowers. This assignment involves Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets, Creating a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data and Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report.

## The Results:

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
