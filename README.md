# Credit Risk Analysis

## An Overview of the Analysis:

The objective of this analysis is to use Supervised Machine Learning to create a model to evaluate loan risk. We will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to create a model that can pinpoint the creditworthiness of borrowers. This assignment involves Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets, Creating a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data and Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report.

## The Results:

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

â€¢	Accuracy Score:

Accuracy Score: The model with the original data has an accuracy score of 99%, indicating the overall correctness of the model across both classes.
Precision Score:
For healthy loans (0): 1.00 (indicating no false positives for healthy loans)
For high-risk loans (1): 0.84 (indicating a low rate of false positives for high-risk loans)
