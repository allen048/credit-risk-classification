# Credit Risk Analysis

## An Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to build a machine learning model that can help predict credit risk. By leveraging historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company, we aim to identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. This project entails preprocessing data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and then implementing a logistic regression model to classify the risk associated with the loan status.
