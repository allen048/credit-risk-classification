# Credit Risk Analysis

## An Overview of the Analysis:

The objective of this analysis is to use Supervised Machine Learning to create a model to evaluate loan risk. We will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to create a model that can pinpoint the creditworthiness of borrowers. This assignment involves Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets, Creating a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data and Writing a Credit Risk Analysis Report.

## The Results:

### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

•	Accuracy Score: This machine learning model produces an accuracy score of 99% for the training and testing sets. This displays an absolute   percentage for this model.

•	Precision Score: This score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision (all positive predictions are correct), and 0     
  indicates no positive predictions are 
	correct.
  -	(‘0’) Healthy loans: 1.00
  -	(‘1’) High-Risk loans: 0.85

•	Recall Score: This score also ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect recall and 0 indicates no relevant instances are 		identified. Recall is particularly important when the cost of false negatives is high, as in the in case of identifying high-risk 	loans.
  -	(‘0’) Healthy loans: 0.99
  -	(‘1’) High-Risk loans: 0.91

### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

•	Accuracy Score: This machine learning model produces an accuracy score of 99% for the logistic regression model. This displays an absolute percentage for this model.

•	Precision Score:
	-	(‘0’) Healthy loans: 1.00
  	-	(‘1’) High-Risk loans: 0.84

•	Recall Score:
	-	(‘0’) Healthy loans: 0.99
  	-	(‘1’) High-Risk loans: 0.99
